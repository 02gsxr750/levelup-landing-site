You are auditing the Android Play Store build issues for Level Up:
1) Some images/videos will not load
2) Coin shop / coins button does nothing when tapped (no navigation, no modal)

DO NOT change code yet.
ONLY inspect and report with file paths + exact functions/components involved.

A) COIN SHOP TAP PATH (ANDROID)
- Find every UI entry point that can open Coin Shop:
  - buttons/CTAs labeled: "Coins", "Coin Shop", coin balance header, buy coins, etc.
- For each, list:
  - File path
  - Component name
  - onPress handler code
  - What it tries to do (navigate route, open WebView URL, open native screen, open external link, etc.)

B) WEBVIEW NAVIGATION / LINK INTERCEPT
- If mobile uses a WebView shell, identify:
  - The WebView component file
  - Any onMessage / onNavigationStateChange / shouldStartLoadWithRequest handlers
  - Any URL allowlist/denylist logic
  - Any route mapping to CoinShop (e.g., "CoinShop", "/coins", "/shop", "/coin-shop")
- Report whether Android differs from iOS in these handlers.

C) REVENUECAT / PLAY BILLING HOOK
- Locate where RevenueCat is initialized:
  - file path
  - platform-specific keys
  - configuration (apiKey selection, appUserID, debug logs)
- Locate where purchases are triggered from the UI:
  - file path(s)
  - function used (purchasePackage / purchaseProduct / purchaseStoreProduct etc.)
  - error handling and logging behavior
- Report if any code is still pointing to Stripe URLs or old coin shop flow.

D) MEDIA RENDERING PATH (ANDROID)
- Identify the media rendering components used in feed/profile/challenges:
  - image component(s)
  - video component(s) (expo-av, react-native-video, etc.)
- For each, list:
  - file path
  - how the URL is formed (signed URL / direct Supabase URL / cached URL)
  - MIME/extension assumptions
  - any HEIC/HEVC handling logic you previously added
  - any fallback logic on error

E) SIGNED URL / SUPABASE STORAGE HEADERS
- Locate the API route / server function that generates signed URLs.
- Report:
  - cache headers
  - TTL
  - whether it returns content-type or relies on Supabase default
  - whether Android receives different URLs than web/iOS (any platform param?)

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
1) Coin Shop Entry Points (table)
2) WebView Intercept Summary (bullet list)
3) RevenueCat Purchase Path Summary (bullet list)
4) Media Render Summary (table)
5) Likely Root Causes (ranked list)
NO CODE CHANGES YET.
