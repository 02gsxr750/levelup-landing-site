You are working in the joinlevelupapp.com web repo. We are LIVE on both app stores now, so we no longer want the “iOS TestFlight” and “Android APK” buttons/links anywhere on the landing page.

GOAL
Replace those two buttons so they keep the same styling/position/layout, but now link to the live app store pages.

LIVE STORE LINKS
- iOS App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/level-up-challenges/id6754522127
- Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marshellventures.levelup

REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT BREAK UI)
1) Keep the same button styling, sizing, icons, colors, spacing, and layout. Only change:
   - button text (optional) and
   - the href / onClick destination.
2) Replace “iOS TestFlight” button:
   - New label: “Download on the App Store” (or “App Store” if space is tight)
   - Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/level-up-challenges/id6754522127
3) Replace “Android APK” button:
   - New label: “Get it on Google Play” (or “Google Play” if space is tight)
   - Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marshellventures.levelup
4) Both buttons MUST open the store links in a new tab/window:
   - If using <a>: add target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"
   - If using a button handler: use window.open(url, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer")
5) Remove any APK download references or TestFlight references:
   - No “testflight.apple.com” links
   - No “.apk” download links
   - No copy that suggests beta / test builds
6) Leave the “App Preview” button exactly as-is.

STEP 1 — INSPECT (MANDATORY)
Search the repo to find where these buttons are rendered and what they currently link to:
- Find occurrences of the strings:
  "iOS TestFlight"
  "Android APK"
  "testflight"
  ".apk"
- List the exact file paths and line numbers where they are found.
- Confirm what component/page is used for the landing hero section that shows these buttons on mobile.
Do not change anything yet—just report findings first.

STEP 2 — IMPLEMENT
After inspection, make the minimal code change(s) to swap the destinations and labels as described above while preserving styling.
- If the buttons are components, update props.
- If the buttons are hardcoded, update the href/onClick.
- Ensure the icons remain (Apple icon stays with iOS button; Android icon stays with Android button).

STEP 3 — VERIFY
- Confirm both links work and open in a new tab.
- Confirm no TestFlight/APK references remain in the landing page UI.
- Provide the diff/patch of the files changed.

OUTPUT
1) Inspection report (files + line numbers)
2) Diffs
3) Short verification checklist results
