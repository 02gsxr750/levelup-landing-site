You are working in the Level Up web repo (Next.js App Router). Fix the existing /sponsors page COPY ONLY so it exactly matches the Sponsor Program language and rules I provided below. Do NOT invent new benefits. Do NOT add “priority support,” “account manager,” “analytics dashboard,” or anything not explicitly listed.

PRIMARY GOAL
1) Remove any “real coin” language and replace with compliant language:
   - Use: “platform coins” / “coin prize pools” / “coins have no cash value”
   - Never say “real coin” or imply cash value or guaranteed ROI.

2) Update ALL Sponsor Program copy on /sponsors to exactly match the spec below:
   - Headline, description, Requirements, tier names, prices, bullets, notes
   - Keep CTA labels (Choose Starter / Choose Pro / Choose Elite) and “Manage Subscription”
   - Keep current layout/styling and Stripe wiring (checkout + billing portal) unchanged.
   - Only text changes.

REQUIRED SPONSOR PROGRAM COPY (USE VERBATIM)
Sponsor Program

⚠️ Requirements
• Must be an Influencer member before accessing Sponsor Program
• Minimum prize pool: 25,000 coins per sponsored challenge
• Coins are locked in escrow when challenge is created
• Winner receives prize pool automatically when challenge ends

🌱 Starter Sponsor - $49/month
• 1 active sponsored challenge at a time
• Sponsored badge on challenge cards
• Small banner on challenge detail page
• Basic stats (views, entries, winner)
• Coin prize pool escrow & automatic payout

⚡ Pro Sponsor - $149/month
• Everything in Starter
• Up to 3 active sponsored challenges
• Higher feed priority among sponsored challenges
• Join-screen sponsor intro card
• 10,000 bonus coins per month
• Expanded stats: entries, unique participants, votes

👑 Elite Sponsor - $399/month

Note: All tiers require Influencer membership ($9.99/mo) as a prerequisite. Sponsored challenge coins are held in escrow until the challenge ends, then distributed to the winner. Coins have no cash value. Sponsor subscriptions are purchased and managed on the web.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide a diff showing exactly what text changed in the /sponsors page (and any related /sponsors/success copy if it mentions coins).
- Do not change any API route handlers or Stripe logic.
- Do not change component structure or styling—copy only.
