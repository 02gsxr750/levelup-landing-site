You are working in the Level Up repo. We need a MINIMAL website update to satisfy Google Play’s “Child Safety Standards” requirement for a Social app with user-generated content.

GOAL
Add a “Child Safety & Abuse Prevention” (CSAE/CSAM) section to the existing Privacy Policy page at:
https://joinlevelupapp.com/privacy

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT rewrite or reformat the entire policy.
- Only add the smallest required section.
- Preserve existing headings, tone, and structure.
- Keep the “Last Updated: December 2025” line as-is unless the privacy page already auto-generates dates.
- Do not change URLs, routing, layout, or styling unless required to place the new text cleanly.
- Output a diff and the exact file path(s) changed.

STEP 1 — INSPECT (NO CHANGES YET)
1) Locate the source file that renders the Privacy Policy content for /privacy.
   - It may be in Next.js app router, e.g. web/app/privacy/page.tsx or similar.
2) Confirm whether the privacy policy text is hard-coded in the page, pulled from a markdown file, or from a CMS/config.
3) Report the exact file path + how the content is stored.

STEP 2 — APPLY MINIMAL CHANGE
Insert the following new section text EXACTLY (word-for-word) immediately AFTER the existing section titled “8. Children's Privacy” (or directly below it). If numbering must be adjusted, do the smallest renumbering necessary.

NEW SECTION TO INSERT:

9. Child Safety & Abuse Prevention

Level Up has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).

We do not allow content that depicts, promotes, or facilitates child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under any circumstances.

Users may report content or accounts that violate our safety policies by contacting support@joinlevelupapp.com. We investigate reports promptly and take appropriate action, including content removal, account termination, and reporting to relevant authorities when required by law.

Level Up complies with all applicable child safety laws and cooperates with law enforcement and regulatory authorities as required.

Notes:
- Keep the text formatting consistent with the rest of the page (same paragraph spacing / bullet style if any).
- Do not add links unless the page already uses them.
- Ensure the section is visible on the /privacy page and not hidden behind collapsed UI.

STEP 3 — OUTPUT
1) Provide the git diff (or file diff) showing only the minimal edits.
2) Provide the final rendered section location (e.g., “inserted after ‘8. Children’s Privacy’”).
3) Provide the exact command(s) to run locally to verify the page renders (if needed).
4) Do NOT deploy automatically. Stop after changes are ready and wait for my “next” to deploy.
