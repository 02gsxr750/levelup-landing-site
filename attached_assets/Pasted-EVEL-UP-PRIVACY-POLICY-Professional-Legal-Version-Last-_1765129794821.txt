✅ Replit Prompt — Add This Privacy Policy to Your Website

Copy/paste this into Replit Chat for your landing site:

REPLIT PROMPT (Copy/Paste):

I need to add a complete Privacy Policy page to my Level Up landing site and wire the footer's Privacy link so it opens this new page.

Requirements:

Create a new file /src/PrivacyPage.tsx that displays the full Privacy Policy text below (preserve formatting and section headers).

Use the same layout, max-width container, and background styling as the landing page so it feels consistent.

Add a “Back to Home” button at the top of the page.

Update the router or app state so that clicking “Privacy” in the footer loads this new PrivacyPage. If you’re not using a router, simple state-based view switching is fine.

Ensure mobile responsiveness.

Here is the full Privacy Policy text—insert it exactly as provided:

After implementing the page, tell me which files you created or modified and confirm that the Privacy link now works correctly.
