You are working in the Level Up website repo. We need to update the public Privacy Policy page to be App Store compliant with minimal edits.

GOAL
Add two disclosures to the Privacy Policy page:
1) Virtual Coins & Purchases: coins may be earned or purchased via Apple IAP, are virtual-only, have no cash value, cannot be redeemed/transferred, not gambling/financial instruments.
2) Apple In-App Purchase processing: purchases are processed by Apple; we do not receive/store payment card info.

MANDATORY PROCESS (DO THIS FIRST)
1) Locate the Privacy Policy page that renders at /privacy on https://www.joinlevelupapp.com/privacy
2) Identify the exact file path(s) and component(s) responsible for that page (Next.js route/page/component, Markdown file, CMS content, etc.)
3) Print a short “Privacy Page Map” showing:
   - File path(s)
   - Whether content is hardcoded vs sourced
   - Where the policy text lives

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Make the smallest possible change: do NOT rewrite the entire policy.
- Preserve all existing headings, numbering, and wording.
- Only insert the new text in the most appropriate place(s).
- Do NOT change styling, layout, or routing.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.

CONTENT TO INSERT (VERBATIM)
A) Insert this new subsection under Section 3 (How We Use Your Information), after “B. Support core features” OR as Section 3F if preferred:

Virtual Coins & Purchases
Level Up offers virtual coins that may be earned through participation or purchased through Apple’s in-app purchase system. Coins are virtual items used solely within the Level Up platform for features such as challenges, boosts, and cosmetic enhancements.
Coins have no real-world monetary value, cannot be redeemed for cash or transferred outside the app, and do not constitute gambling or financial instruments.

B) Insert this sentence under Section 4A (Service Providers), preferably after the provider list:

All in-app purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. Level Up does not receive or store users’ payment card information.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
- Visiting /privacy displays the added “Virtual Coins & Purchases” subsection and the Apple IAP sentence.
- No other policy text changed.
- Build passes (npm/pnpm) and page renders without errors.

OUTPUT
1) List files changed with small diffs
2) Confirm where the new text was inserted (section numbers)
3) Provide the final rendered snippet exactly as it appears on the page
