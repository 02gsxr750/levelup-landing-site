You are working in the Level Up web repo (Next.js App Router). Build a production-ready Sponsor page at:

  /sponsors

This page must match our “About page rules”:
- Clean, direct, competitive tone (Level Up is votes not comments; debate lives in content; bragging rights + exposure; leaderboard-driven, not algorithm-driven).
- Keep it compliant: Purchases happen on the WEBSITE only via Stripe (no in-app purchase flow). Include a clear disclaimer: “Sponsor subscriptions are purchased and managed on the web. The mobile app only links out to this page.”
- Keep coins disclaimer consistent: “Coins have no cash value.”

GOAL
Create a full sponsor marketing page + Stripe web flows that support:
1) Purchase (new subscription) for Starter / Pro / Elite via Stripe Checkout
2) Manage subscription (upgrade/downgrade/cancel/payment method) via Stripe Billing Portal

ASSUMPTIONS / INPUTS (use env + placeholder if unknown)
- We already have Stripe webhooks provisioning sponsor status in Supabase (do not rebuild webhooks here).
- We will create checkout sessions and portal sessions from the web server (Next.js route handlers).
- Pricing is defined in Stripe with 3 recurring Prices:
  STARTER_PRICE_ID, PRO_PRICE_ID, ELITE_PRICE_ID
- If we can determine the logged-in user, we should attach metadata for provisioning alignment:
  metadata: { user_id, profile_id, tier }
- Auth: If the site already has Supabase auth, use it to get the current user/profile. If not available, still allow checkout, but at minimum pass customer_email if we have it. Do not block shipping this page just because auth details differ—degrade gracefully.

WHAT TO BUILD (FILES)
1) Page UI
- Create: web/app/sponsors/page.tsx
- A clean layout:
  - Hero: “Sponsor Level Up” + subheader
  - 3 tier cards (Starter, Pro, Elite) with short bullet features aligned to our sponsor program:
    Starter: featured sponsor challenge placement + basic sponsor badge
    Pro: featured + periodic feed placement (approx every 25 items) + better prominence
    Elite: higher frequency (approx every 12 items) + top priority prominence
  - Each card shows price placeholder (not hardcoded if you can’t reliably fetch) and a CTA:
      “Choose Starter / Choose Pro / Choose Elite”
  - A separate section: “Already a sponsor?” with button:
      “Manage Subscription”
  - FAQ with compliance language:
      - Web-only purchases & management
      - Cancel anytime in portal
      - When benefits activate (after successful checkout; provisioning via webhook)
      - Coins have no cash value (if mentioned)
  - Footer links: Privacy, Terms

2) Stripe Checkout Session API
- Create: web/app/api/stripe/sponsors/checkout/route.ts
- POST accepts JSON: { tier: "starter"|"pro"|"elite", returnPath?: string }
- Server validates tier -> selects correct price id from env:
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_STARTER_PRICE_ID
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_PRO_PRICE_ID
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_ELITE_PRICE_ID
- Create Stripe Checkout Session (subscription mode):
    mode: "subscription"
    line_items: [{ price: PRICE_ID, quantity: 1 }]
    allow_promotion_codes: true (optional)
    success_url: `${SITE_URL}/sponsors/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
    cancel_url: `${SITE_URL}/sponsors`
- Attach metadata if user is known:
    metadata: { tier, user_id, profile_id }
- If user email known, set customer_email.
- Return JSON: { url: session.url }

3) Stripe Billing Portal API
- Create: web/app/api/stripe/sponsors/portal/route.ts
- POST creates a billing portal session for the sponsor’s Stripe customer
- You must find the Stripe customer id for the current user.
  - If the app already stores stripe_customer_id in Supabase (profiles table or a billing table), fetch it.
  - If unknown, attempt lookup by email using Stripe Customer search (only if you have permission; otherwise return a friendly error that instructs user to contact support).
- Return JSON: { url: portalSession.url }
- Return URL back to `${SITE_URL}/sponsors`

4) Success Page
- Create: web/app/sponsors/success/page.tsx
- Shows “You’re in. Sponsorship activating…” + explains provisioning happens automatically (webhook) and may take a moment.
- Button: “Back to Sponsors” and “Open App” (optional deep link if we already have one; otherwise omit).

5) Client actions
- On /sponsors page:
  - Clicking a tier CTA calls POST /api/stripe/sponsors/checkout with { tier } then redirects browser to returned url
  - Clicking “Manage Subscription” calls POST /api/stripe/sponsors/portal then redirects to returned url
- Use a small client component for the buttons (loading state + error toast). Keep it minimal.

6) Configuration + Safety
- Add env requirements (do not commit secrets):
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_STARTER_PRICE_ID
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_PRO_PRICE_ID
    STRIPE_SPONSOR_ELITE_PRICE_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (e.g. https://joinlevelupapp.com)
- Ensure route handlers are server-only and never expose secret keys.
- Use Stripe API version default; use official stripe sdk.
- Add basic validation + error handling (return 400 on bad tier, 500 on Stripe errors).

7) Notes on Upgrade/Downgrade/Cancel
- Do NOT build custom upgrade/downgrade UI.
- We rely on Stripe Billing Portal configuration to allow:
    - plan changes (upgrade/downgrade)
    - cancellation
    - payment method update
- Put copy on the page that clearly says: “Manage, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime in the billing portal.”

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- If the repo already has a Stripe helper (e.g., web/lib/stripe.ts) use it. Otherwise create one:
    web/lib/stripe.ts:
      import Stripe from "stripe";
      export const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, { apiVersion: "..." as any });
- If the repo already uses Supabase server client helpers, use them to fetch user + stripe_customer_id.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide the exact code changes for all created files and any modified files.
- Keep styling consistent with Level Up: black background, clean sections, bold headings, neon accent optional, but keep it readable.
- Do not change any existing sponsor provisioning/webhook logic.

After implementing, output:
- The URLs that should work:
    /sponsors
    /sponsors/success
- Example curl commands for testing checkout + portal endpoints.
